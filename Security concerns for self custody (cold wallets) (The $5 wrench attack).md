# Description
  
Security concerns for self custody (cold wallets) arise from the fact that if a user's computer is compromised, the thief would have access to the user's entire wallet and could steal all of the cryptocurrency. One solution to this problem is to use a hardware wallet, which is a physical device that stores the user's private keys. Another solution is to use a paper wallet, which is a document that contains the user's private keys.
