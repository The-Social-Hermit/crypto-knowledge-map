# Description
  
Cryptocurrencies are created through a process called mining. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain. The number of cryptocurrency created is predetermined and decreases over time. The decrease in the number of cryptocurrency created is designed to match the increase in demand. As a result, the supply and demand for cryptocurrency is in equilibrium.
