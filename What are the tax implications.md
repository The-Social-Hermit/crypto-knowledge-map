[[How the US government views crypto assets]]

# Description
  
  
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure their transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control. This makes them attractive to some users because of the perceived anonymity and lack of government regulation. Cryptocurrencies are often traded on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services. Because they are not regulated, the tax implications of owning and using cryptocurrencies can be complex.
