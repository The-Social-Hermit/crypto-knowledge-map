# Description
A layer 2 protocol is a protocol that sits on top of a layer 1 protocol and provides additional features. Bitcoin is a layer 1 protocol and the Lightning network is a layer 2 protocol that builds on top of Bitcoin. Layer 2 protocols can be used to add features to a cryptocurrency or to improve the performance of a cryptocurrency.
