# Description
A ledger is a record of financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies use a distributed ledger which is a database that is shared by all nodes participating in a network. Transactions are verified by consensus of the participants in the network. This distributed ledger is used to record transactions and to track the ownership of digital assets.
