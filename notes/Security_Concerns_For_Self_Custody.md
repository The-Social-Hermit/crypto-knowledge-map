# Description
  
Security concerns for self custody (cold wallets) arise from the fact that if a users computer is compromised the thief would have access to the users entire wallet and could steal all of the cryptocurrency. One solution to this problem is to use a hardware wallet which is a physical device that stores the users private keys. Another solution is to use a paper wallet which is a document that contains the users private keys.
