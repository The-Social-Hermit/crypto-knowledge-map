# Crypto Knowledge Map  
A vault to hold the knowledge required to responsibly self custody your own crypto.   
   
An open repository of information designed to grow.  
   
# How it Works  
This information vault has two versions that exist harmoniously in parallel. It is designed to be used both as an Obsidian vault and an accessible web interface. The Obsidian vault allows you to use the powerful note taking and editing software Obsidian, and the web version allows anyone to access it without any specialized software.   
   
## Using the Web Version  
The Obsidian vault is hosted using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) on GitHub pages at:   
   
[https://lpurdy01.github.io/crypto-knowledge-map/](https://lpurdy01.github.io/crypto-knowledge-map/)   
   
   
This creates a version of the notes anyone can explore without any specialized software.   
   
   
Browse around and take a look!  
  
### Some Places to Check Out:  
[[A_Learning_Order]] - The concepts structured into logical sections.  
  
  
[[Learning_Order_Graph]] - A graph of how the concepts relate.   
  
  
[[What_is_Ethereum]] - A little far in, but it has a cool subgraph.  
   
   
## Using Obsidian  
Originally this knowledge map is built around the Obsidian note taking software. You can find it at: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  
  
Obsidian is a fantastic note taking app that allows for the visualization of links between concepts. Its main special feature is the ability to view relationships between notes as an interactive graph. This greatly enhances the ability to see relations between concepts and explore a concept space.

## Making it Your Own  
If you like how [this](https://github.com/lpurdy01/crypto-knowledge-map) knowledgebase is laid out and want to use it on your journey fork and clone this git repository. From there you can open the ```notes``` folder as a vault and go to town.  
  
## Web Resources  
In [the repository](https://github.com/lpurdy01/crypto-knowledge-map) under the ```web_resources``` folder there are the Python scripts used to prepare the markdown flies for MkDocs processing, and generate the graphs for the web version.   
  
I'll write more tutorial here if there is interest.
