# Description
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, usually fiat currency. This allows for a more stable value for the coin, as opposed to cryptocurrencies that can be subject to large price swings. There are a number of different stablecoins in circulation, but the most popular is Tether, which is pegged to the US dollar.
