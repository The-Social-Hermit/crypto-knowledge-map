# Description
  
A decentralized exchange or DEX is a cryptocurrency exchange that is not controlled by any single entity. Instead it is run by a network of users who all have a stake in the exchange. This makes it more secure and less likely to be hacked than traditional exchanges. DEXs also typically have lower fees than traditional exchanges.
